# thunks
posts and code related to topics that I care about

As far as topics go I will probably jump all over the place but more often than not I'll land on one or more of the following topics:

* Software -- especially programming languages and systems
* Books and other reading materials
* Clojure, ClojureScript, and their ecosystems
* Games
* Retrocomputing
* Life in general

You don't need to agree, but please disagree in constructive ways.
