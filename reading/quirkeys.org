/Functional Programming and Its Applications/ by Darlington, Henderson, and Turner

This particular book is on the bubble for my collection as much of what it contains is found scattered throughout other books in my library.

Of particular interest is Henderson's paper "Purely Functional Operating Systems" which was difficult to find the last I checked.
