* cassette futurism

[[https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cassette_Futurism][a retrofuturistic aesthetic]] that came onto my radar recently but that seems to follow a pattern of modern thought that has grown in recent times.

related topics that i've followed to varying degrees as as follows.

** black mirror
** cyberdecks
** glass bead game
** hauntology
** icehouse
** lost futures
** retrocomputing
** retrofuturism
** scarfolk
** the new aesthetic
** further

there is a sub-genre of science fiction hiding in here... what could have been for the modern programmer:

** LISPM Futurism 

a sub-genre of sci-fi predicated on a past where LISP and John McCarthy's ideas drove the computing industry from the 1950s to the present.

*** What exists now that would also exist under LISPM Futurism?

Listed below, likely any LISPMF manifestation would be different, but the spirit would likely still be there.

**** Single-board computers
**** Common Lisp
**** Datomic
**** Emacs
**** Genera / Mezzano
**** VLSI
**** iRobot
**** scsh

*** What disappeared but may have prospered under LISPM Futurism?
**** Lisp Machines
**** Lisp Processors
