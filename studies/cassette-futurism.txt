there is a sub-genre of science fiction hiding in here... what could have been for the modern programmer:

LISPM Futurism -- a sub-genre of sci-fi predicated on a past where LISP and John McCarthy's ideas drove the computing industry from the 1950s to the present.

*** What exists now that would also exist under LISPM Futurism?

Listed below, likely any LISPMF manifestation would be different, but the spirit would likely still be there.

**** Single-board computers
**** Common Lisp
**** Datomic
**** Emacs
