* 1OO

Idea: Read 100 books on OOP and see how many unconventional ideas I can reap from them. I’ve read so many OO books in my time I feel like there are no more surprises to be found. I want to be wrong. There are of course numerous OO books that I've read and found inspiring and that had great ideas inside:

I've read many more OO books in my time but if I wanted to read 100 more, then those that I might pick are found in the next section. If a book that might fit isn't listed then I [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/266149-michael?utf8=✓&search%5Bquery%5D=oriented][may]] have [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/266149-michael?utf8=✓&search%5Bquery%5D=java][already]] read [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/266149-michael?utf8=✓&search%5Bquery%5D=c%2B%2B][it]] in [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/266149-michael?utf8=✓&search%5Bquery%5D=smalltalk][the]] past. However, I'm happy to take recommendations if you have them.

** The next 100

What I'm looking for:

- Books that I haven't already read
- Books with pre-OO and/or proto-OO ideas
- Books with non-mainstream OO techniques

This is a living list. Books in italics are must-reads (for me).
